           user experience == UX 
           user  interface == UI 

Considering and designing for the user and not what you think the user 
wants are key to successful UX.
UX includes everything related to all the interactions that a user has with a company, its services and products.  

UX stands for ‘user experience’. The user experience relates to how a user feels whenever they interact with a product or service. It’s not a physical, tangible thing—it’s the ease and user-friendliness of the interaction as a whole.

UI stands for ‘user interface’. The user interface relates specifically to the screens, buttons and other visual and interactive features a person uses to interact with a digital product, such as a website or app


FIGMA
===========

Frame => a container where your design lives
Layer => an object within a frame
group => multiple objects can be combined, and once combined,
         a single top layer is created which contains all 
         the objects.

Frames and groups appear very similar. 
 -> both help organize your file by nesting layers or
    grouping layers together. 
However, frame supply a lot more functionality like independent sizing

###---->
A frame's size is independent of its children. The size of the parent frame
will not change if the children are moved or resized. 
        parent frame >= children. 
In contrast to Groups, where the group must be the same size as its children. 

###---->
Your frame is similar to a window. When you resize your frame, you are only 
resizing the window through which you are looking. 

##
Designing with frames is the key to unlocking Figma's most powerful features. 
You'll be able to create designs that are well-organized, beautifully styled, 
simple to use, scrollable and resizable.

***************
A web page or app is built of squares and rectangles, which are contained within a 
grid system or a structure of invisible lines and columns. They organize the content 
on the page, and create alignment and order. They form the basic structure of the 
user interface.

How to create a webpage ?
----------------------------

The most common number of columns are 12 on desktop,
8 on a tablet, and 4 on a mobile

gutter == 20 px. 
grid  == 12 col
type == stretch (width will automatically grow/shrink)
margin == 70 ( to keep the grid responsive) 


VERTICLE
--------
most of the screen sizes are 8, eight point grid

count == 1000
type == top 
height == 8 
gutter == 0
ofset == 0

(ctr + shift+4) ===> turn grid on/off
select all layers and give constraint to left-to-right ( responsive )


Manipulate element
--------------------
When I resize a group( or multiple layers ),,, its child elements will scale. 



IMAGES
=========
How to insert an image
1)ctr shift K
2) using drag drop
3) using fill option 

Masking
--------
select any shape 
from fill section selecgt the images
the image will appear in shape selected



WIREFRAMING
===============

The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for
each screen and the design 


Wireframing is a process of creating low-fidelity sketches of a website
or app's layout.
It is used to visualize the structure of the page and how users 
will interact with it. 
Wireframes are typically created before any design or development work is done.



Usability Testing
===================
Usability testing is the process of getting actual people to use a 
website app or other products you've designed while tracking their 
actions and reactions.

Users are given task to perform and if many people faces same issue,
a reccomendation is sent to fix the issue

the facilitator, the participant and the tasks given are the leading
players in most of them

Types of usability testing
1) qualitative usability testing 
   - it aims to gather insights, results and narratives about how users 
     interact with the product.
2) quantitative usability testing 
   - it is to gather metrics that capture the user experience. Tasks, success 
     and time on task are two metrics frequently collected in quantitative 
     usability testing.


Enhancing Design
-----------------
Design elements are important for creating beautiful and effective digital 
interfaces. The main design elements are lines, text, color, shapes, 
graphic elements, and space.


Component
---------
 A component has two characteristics, a master and an instance, which is a copy of the master.
